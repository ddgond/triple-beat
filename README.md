# Triple Beat
Triple Beat is a rhythm game I developed for the July 2019 Summer Slow
Jams game jam organized by Portland Indie Game Squad. The themes was
"3-Button, 3-Color Games", and I took the opportunity to create an
original rhythm game of my own. It has a strange control scheme due to
limitations of the MacBook keyboard (it won't register pressing the up
arrow, left arrow, and right arrow at the same time), but it's very
playable and enjoyable. It only has one song included (which I wrote),
but it also includes a built-in map editor which can be used to add
more. I am quite proud of this game, as I put a lot of effort into
the aesthetics, mechanics, and music. It was also my first solo game
jam, and my first time creating an editor of any kind. Development
went smoothly and I couldn't be happier with the result. Plus, it works
on Mac, Windows, AND Linux!
